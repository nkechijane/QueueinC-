Create an application (preferably a Windows Forms Application, but console app with a menu will suffice) in Visual Studio (GUI) for C#, to store and update a queue of customer’s names.
The app should allow to store up to 20 customer’s names, and should allow:
	•	to add and remove customer names from the queue (use enqueue / dequeue)
	•	display the total number of names in the queue
	•	display the full contents of the queue
